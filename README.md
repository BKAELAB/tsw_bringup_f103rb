## Source Code
  1. [STM32F103RB F/W](https://github.com/BKAELAB/BKEL_SomeIP_GateWay/tree/mcu) : move to mcu branch

## Communication Concept
  1. CLIENT accept to Well-Known IP (Ref. DDS)
  2. MCU Send ALL Service ID&Info via Gateway

## Features
  1. RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
  2. Diagnosis

## To be update
  1. To prepare for expandability, the existing UART communication method will be **replaced with a CAN BUS configuration.**
  2. Client authentication system scheduled to be introduced for security
